## Week 1: 01 of Novemeber 2021 to November 8 2021

***This week Progress:** Started Zero to Panda Course https://jovian.ai/learn/data-analysis-with-python-zero-to-pandas/lesson/lesson-1-introduction-to-programming-with-python

### Lesson: 
1. Relearning the basics of python such as the variable, data type and conditional statement and loop.
2. Learn what jupyter notebook and visual code all about and how to install them on the machine.
