# My-Journey-into-Data-Science
My Journey for sixty days of python coding-learning-debugging and data science concepts, therefore this a repository on learning data science which would contain my note, assignemnt and project undertake during the 60 days before my thesis proposal.

## Week 1: 01 of novemeber 2021 to November 8 2021

***This week Progress:** Started Zero to Panda Course https://jovian.ai/learn/data-analysis-with-python-zero-to-pandas/lesson/lesson-1-introduction-to-programming-with-python

### Lesson: 
1. Relearning the basics of python such as the variable, data type and conditional statement and loop.
2. Learn what jupyter notebook and visual code all about and how to install them on the machine.
3. Build a time calculator using python https://github.com/anafisad/My-Journey-into-Data-Science/blob/main/Project/python/time%20calculator
4. Work with boolean function and conditional statement on jupyter notebook.
5. Pratice data type and method fuction on jupyter.
6. Learn about operator, data structure.


### Note: I spent 4 hour on learning about pyhton, code a time calculator from scratch and documenting my journey here on GitHub.


## Week 2: 09 of novemeber 2021 to November 13 2021

### Lesson: 
1. Working with numerical data in Python
2. Going from Python lists to Numpy arrays
3. Multi-dimensional Numpy arrays and their benefits
4. Array operations, broadcasting, indexing, and slicing
5. Working with CSV data files using Numpy
6. Reading a CSV file into a Pandas data frame
7. Retrieving data from Pandas data frames
8. Querying, soring, and analyzing data
9. Merging, grouping, and aggregation of data
10. Extracting useful information from dates
11. Basic plotting using line and bar charts
12. Writing data frames to CSV files


## Week 4: 21 of novemeber 2021 to November 26 2021

**This week Progress:** Started Zero to Panda Course https://jovian.ai/learn/data-analysis-with-python-zero-to-pandas/lesson/lesson-5-data-visualization-with-matplotlib-and-seaborn

### Lesson: 
1. Creating and customizing line charts using Matplotlib
2. Visualizing relationships between two or more variables using scatter plots
3. Studying distributions of variables using histograms & bar charts to
4. Visualizing two-dimensional data using heatmaps
5. Displaying images using Matplotlib's plt.imshow
6. Plotting multiple Matplotlib and Seaborn charts in a grid



## Week 5: 27 of novemeber 2021 to November 31 2021

## Note
I won a scholarship to study data science on Data Camp by Ingressive, due to that reason, i decided to focus my time using data camp and working on the jovian assignement

**This week Progress:** Datacamp Data Science Course

### Lesson: 
1. Learn the defintion of data science is.
2. Learn data science workflow
3. How data science is applied to real-world problems
4. Learning about different roles within the data science field
5. Learning about the different data sources you can draw from
6. Learning what that data looks like
7. Learning how to store the data once it's collected
8. Learning how a data pipeline can automate the process.
