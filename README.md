# My-Journey-into-Data-Science
My Journey for sixty days of python coding-learning-debugging and data science concepts, therefore this a repository on learning data science which would contain my note, assignemnt and project undertake during the 60 days before my thesis proposal.


## Roadmap
- First steps with Python: https://jovian.ai/aakashns/first-steps-with-python
- Variables and data types: https://jovian.ai/aakashns/python-variables-and-data-types
- Conditional statements and loops: https://jovian.ai/aakashns/python-branching-and-loops

## Resources
- Data Analysis with Python: Zero to Pandas https://jovian.ai/learn/data-analysis-with-python-zero-to-pandas
- Python Tutorial at W3Schools: https://www.w3schools.com/python/
- Practical Python Programming: https://dabeaz-course.github.io/practical-python/Notes/Contents.html
- Python official documentation: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html


## Week 1: 01 of novemeber 2021 to November 8 2021

***This week Progress:** Started Zero to Panda Course https://jovian.ai/learn/data-analysis-with-python-zero-to-pandas/lesson/lesson-1-introduction-to-programming-with-python

### Lesson: 
1. Relearning the basics of python such as the variable, data type and conditional statement and loop.
2. Learn what jupyter notebook and visual code all about and how to install them on the machine.
3. Build a time calculator using python https://github.com/anafisad/My-Journey-into-Data-Science/blob/main/Project/python/time%20calculator
4. Work with boolean function and conditional statement on jupyter notebook.
5. Pratice data type and method fuction on jupyter.
6. Learn about operator, data structure.


### Note: I spent 4 hour on learning about pyhton, code a time calculator from scratch and documenting my journey here on GitHub.
